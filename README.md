üè† Housing Data Analysis Project
This project focuses on analyzing a comprehensive housing dataset containing essential attributes such as price, location, size, and property condition. The goal is to extract meaningful insights and provide data-driven recommendations for stakeholders in the real estate industry.

üìä Dataset Overview
The dataset includes detailed information on residential properties, such as:

Date: Record date of the property listing

Price: Sale price of the property

Bedrooms / Bathrooms: Number of rooms

Sqft_living / Sqft_lot: Square footage of living area and land

Floors: Number of floors

Waterfront: Binary indicator (yes/no) for waterfront view

View: Quality rating of the property's view (0‚Äì4)

Condition: Overall property condition (1‚Äì5)

Sqft_above / Sqft_basement: Above-ground and basement areas

Yr_built / Yr_renovated: Year built and renovated

Street / City / Statezip / Country: Location details

‚úÖ Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handle missing values (imputation/removal)

Correct inconsistent or erroneous entries

Encode categorical variables for analysis

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate Analysis: Understand distributions (price, bedrooms, bathrooms)

Bivariate Analysis: Relationships (e.g., price vs. sqft_living)

Multivariate Analysis: Detect correlations and trends across variables

3. Data Visualization
Use histograms, box plots, and scatter plots

Highlight price trends, outliers, and geographical variations

4. Feature Engineering
Derive new metrics like property age and price per square foot

Create features to support deeper insights

5. Insights & Recommendations
Identify key price drivers (location, property size, condition)

Provide actionable recommendations for real estate decision-makers

üõ† Technologies Used
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook for development

GitHub for version control and collaboration
